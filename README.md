To run the App:
  ```
  npm install

  ```
  ```
  vue serve ./src/main.js
  ```
or
```
  npm run start
 ```

This is simple Vuex App that initializes the first block when app gets started and then you can add some input and hit the button to generate the next block. App will generate the next block with that input, current time, the hash of previous block and will give you the hash of the current block.
